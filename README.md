# NAC nextflow RNA-seq pipeline


## Introduction
This repository contains a Nextflow-based RNA-Seq analysis pipeline. It is designed to process raw RNA-Seq data and produce quantified gene expression profiles.



## Get started

### Clone this repository
You can obtain the pipeline directly from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uschwartz/RNAseq.git
```

### Get help
The pipeline comes with a ready-to-use test data set.
```bash
nextflow run path2nucMACC/RNAseq --help
```
